Masters Program in Computer Science
===================================

I am the Academic Director of the [Masters Program in Computer Science](https://csmasters.uchicago.edu) (MPCS). My role within the program includes designing and maintaing our curriculum, advising students, and leading searches for part-time/adjunct faculty. If you'd like to learn more about the MPCS, including how to apply to the program, please visit [our website](https://csmasters.uchicago.edu)

If you are a current student, you can request an advising appointment [via e-mail]({{< relref "contact.md" >}}). That said, most advising questions can be resolved via e-mail, so I encourage you to first send me your questions before scheduling an in-person meeting.

If you are a prospective student, please contact [questions@cs.uchicago.edu](mailto:questions.cs.uchicago.edu) if you have any questions about the MPCS, or about applying to the MPCS.
