About Me
========

I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science, where I [teach]({{< relref "teaching.md" >}}) intro CS, software development, computer networks, and distributed systems. I am also the Academic Director of the [Masters Program in Computer Science]({{< relref "mpcs.md" >}}). 

I am involved in a number of [other activities]({{< relref "other.md" >}}) on campus, such as being the faculty advisor to the department's student organizations and coaching our [ICPC]({{< relref "other.md#programming-contests" >}}) teams.

I am not actively involved in research at the moment, but my [research]({{< relref "other.md" >}}) has primarily focused on resource allocation on distributed systems using virtualization. I have [published]({{< relref "publications" >}}) a number of papers on those subjects and, more recently, I have also published some papers on Computer Science Education.

I got my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Chicago in 2010, where I wrote my dissertation on *Provisioning Computational Resources Using Virtual Machines and Leases* under the guidance of [Ian Foster](https://www.anl.gov/person/ian-t-foster).

I am originally from [Bilbao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao), a wonderful city in the [Basque Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(greater_region)) region of Spain. I went to college there, and have a degree in *Ingeniería en Informática* (equivalent to a BS/MS in Computer Engineering) from the [University of Deusto](http://www.deusto.es/).

Outside of work, I enjoy watching movies, travelling, hiking, following US politics, cooking Spanish food, and [tweeting](https://twitter.com/borjasotomayor) about all of the above.
