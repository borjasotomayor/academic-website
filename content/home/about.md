Welcome to my University of Chicago page!

I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science, where I [teach]({{< relref "teaching.md" >}}) intro CS, software development, computer networks, and distributed systems. I am also the Academic Director of the [Masters Program in Computer Science]({{< relref "mpcs.md" >}}). 

I am involved in a number of [other activities]({{< relref "other.md" >}}) on campus, such as being the faculty advisor to the department's student organizations and coaching our [ICPC]({{< relref "other.md#programming-contests" >}}) teams.

I am not actively involved in research at the moment, but my [research]({{< relref "other.md" >}}) has primarily focused on resource allocation on distributed systems using virtualization. I have [published]({{< relref "publications" >}}) a number of papers on those subjects and, more recently, I have also published some papers on Computer Science Education.
