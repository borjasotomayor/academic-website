Contact
=======

On the University of Chicago campus, I am located in [Crerar](https://maps.uchicago.edu/location/john-crerar-library/) 209. Although I am usually in my office during regular business hours, the best way to contact me is through e-mail: [borja@cs.uchicago.edu](mailto:borja@cs.uchicago.edu). If you want to drop by my office, please let me know in advance to make sure that I am available that date/time.

*Prospective MPCS students:* If you have questions about the MPCS, please contact [questions@cs.uchicago.edu](mailto:questions.cs.uchicago.edu)

*Current MPCS students:* Please send your questions to [masters-admin@cs.uchicago.edu](mailto:masters-admin@cs.uchicago.edu). This address reaches several people, including myself, and it is more likely that you will receive a prompt reply through that address than if you e-mail me directly.

*Estudiantes hispanoparlantes:* Si preferís comunicaros conmigo en español, por favor no dudeis en hacerlo. Aunque utilizo el inglés por defecto aqui en la Universidad de Chicago, mi lengua materna es el español.
