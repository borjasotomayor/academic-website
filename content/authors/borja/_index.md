Welcome to my University of Chicago page!

I am an Associate Senior Instructional Professor in the Department of Computer Science, where I [teach]({{< ref "teaching" >}}) intro CS, software development, computer networks, and distributed systems. I am also the Director of the [Masters Program in Computer Science]({{< relref "mpcs.md" >}}). 

I am involved in a number of [other activities]({{< relref "other.md" >}}) on campus, such as being the faculty advisor to the department's student organizations.

I am not actively involved in research at the moment, but my [research]({{< relref "research.md" >}}) has primarily focused on resource allocation on distributed systems using virtualization. I have [published]({{< relref "publications" >}}) a number of papers on those subjects and, more recently, I have also published some papers on Computer Science Education.

I also design [t-shirts]({{< relref "t-shirts" >}}).
